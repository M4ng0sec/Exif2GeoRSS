The script takes EXIF GPS metadata from image files (or whatever) and puts it into
a GeoRSS formatted XML file suitable for upload into Bing Maps.

This is very beta. I tested it with images from an iPhone that had location
service turned on for the camera. All of the images tested had GPS metadata. I know
the script will barf on images that do not contain GPS metadata.
